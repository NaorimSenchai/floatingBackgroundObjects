# Floating Background Object

floatingBackgroundObjects.js is script allowing you to simply add one or more images floating from left to right or right to left in the background of any div, section, etc. from your page.

You can use it on any HTML element you want by either referring to its ID, its/their class or simply by its/their tag.
You can also use it with any image you want. Images with transparent background are, however, recommended for a smoother result.

This was my very first JS script so I hope it'll be helpful and/or amusing to use. ^^

## How to use

I worked on making this script as easy to use as possible.
Simply type [b]addFloatingBackgroundObjects(<your html tag>, <your image path>)[/b] and poof! Animated background!
  
A third argument, an object, allows you to customize your floating items' behavior.
I recommend downloading the demon version below to have a clue about it.

The script comes with some JSDoc in order to complete its accessibility.
